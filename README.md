This project is part of an approach to automate the processing of technical requirements
 related to client projects. In industrial processes, manual analysis of these requirements
 is a time-consuming task prone to human error. This work therefore proposes the deve
lopment of a software application capable of automatically extracting requirements from
 structured documents, analyzing their internal logic, and verifying their applicability
 according to the characteristics of ongoing projects.
 The proposed application was developed in Python, using the PyQt5 framework for
 the graphical user interface and SQLite as the database management system, in order
 to provide an efficient, intuitive, and scalable solution.
 The application performs effectively on structured documents. However, some limi
tations remain, particularly the diversity of requirement file formats, which makes fully
 universal support challenging.
